Email myself flashcards once each specified time interval, using a screen. No cron job.

Flashcard directory layout:
-------------
	/flashcards
		/topic1
			a.answer
			a.question
		/topic2
			/subtopic2-1
				b.question
				b.answer
		/topic3

Make sure a flashcard is stored in a folder with 2 text files with extension .question and .answer pls. 

Some downsides:
---------------
* A short flashcard is ~2kB, storage is kind of ridiculous but easy to edit. Potentially will build a better system, but I can do thousands of flashcards right now so it currently satisfies my needs.
* Since solutions are sent as attachments, be sure to filter these and remove them from time to time. 
* Also please unmark if marked as spam.
